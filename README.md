- 👋 Hi, I’m @maliokan
- I am a university student with a strong passion for Cyber.
- With a GPA of 3.90, I am continuously working to enhance my skills, especially in programming languages like Python and Java.
- My goal is to master Bash and penetration testing skills, using these tools to solve complex, real-world problems.
- Outside of academics, I lead my university’s billiards club, write poetry, and find inspiration in philosophy.
- I am driven by a desire to constantly grow, both personally and professionally.
